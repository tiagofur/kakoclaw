error during build:
[vite-plugin-pwa:build] [plugin vite-plugin-pwa:build] There was an error during the build:
  [vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "vue-toastification" from "C:/Users/tfurt/source/repos/kakoclaw/pkg/web/frontend/src/views/ChannelsView.vue".
This is most likely unintended because it can break your application at runtime.
If you do want to externalize this module explicitly add it to
`build.rollupOptions.external`
Additionally, handling the error in the 'buildEnd' hook caused the following error:
  [vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "vue-toastification" from "C:/Users/tfurt/source/repos/kakoclaw/pkg/web/frontend/src/views/ChannelsView.vue".
This is most likely unintended because it can break your application at runtime.
