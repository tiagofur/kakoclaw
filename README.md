## 🌟 Why KakoClaw?

**KakoClaw** is not just another AI assistant. It is a masterpiece of efficiency, born from the code of [PicoClaw](https://github.com/sipeed/picoclaw) and the inspiration of [Nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot).

While other "Claw" projects require heavy resources and expensive hardware, KakoClaw reigns supreme in the realm of **efficiency**:

- 🚀 **1s Boot**: It's ready before you can blink.
- 🧠 **10MB RAM**: Runs comfortably on a toaster.
- 💸 **$10 Hardware**: Optimized for low-cost RISC-V and ARM boards.
- 🤖 **Agent-Refined**: 95% of its core was built by AI, for AI.

## 🤝 Respecting the Roots

KakoClaw is a proud evolution and a hard-fork of [PicoClaw](https://github.com/sipeed/picoclaw). We stand on the shoulders of giants:

1.  **[PicoClaw](https://github.com/sipeed/picoclaw)**: Our direct ancestor and the foundation of our vision.
2.  **[Nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot)**: The original spark of inspiration for ultra-lightweight assistants.

We believe in the democratization of AI. By taking the work of PicoClaw and optimizing it to the extreme in Go, we've created the most efficient agent in the ecosystem.
